The Awesome Demo Game Project of the International Catrobat Association required me to build a fully-fledged on  award-winning app 'Pocket Code' (available both on IOS and Android). I had to submit a proposal with the game idea which was meant to be developed on the Pocket Code app. I designed a rough model of my game idea which included some of the self-made game arts, audio files, and a story. Luckily, this summer I got the chance to be a part of the International Catrobat Association and to create an Awesome Demo game within the whole Google Summer of Code period.
The game is called 'Sisters of the Faldroid' which has a self-made interesting story converted into a game using the Pocket Code app. The game clearly shows the potential of the app and visualizes its work. I am responsible for all the game design code, graphical assets, and some of the music pieces. The assets can be found here in this repository.

### My planning for the Summer

I have always been delighted by the idea of turning my thoughts and ideas into a game and this summer was a huge opportunity to make my dream come true. I had this really interesting story in my brain which I planned to convert into a game for the Google Summer of Code project. After getting selected in GSoC 2021 for this project, I picked up a suitable name for the game, finalized the story, designed more assets and started to code them into the game. Through this game, I wanted to show some of the Pocket Code's functionalities and sensors such as gravity sensors, collision detection, accelerometer and multi-touch. The app also allows you to store data locally on your device which I used to design some arcade games which saves the user Hi-score locally.

### The Google Summer of Code period

##### The Bonding period:
As soon as I got selected for the GSoC project, I started documenting the game story and did a hit and trial with the codes, some of which I used in the game too. With the continuous communication with my mentor, I finalized the story and started working on the most important and time indulging game component i.e. the game art and assets.

##### The Coding Period:
The Coding period had me tied with some problems such as collision detections, player movement, laggy game scenes and with some audio files and these problems could not be ignored.

After a while, by continuing the work remotely and having proper discussions with my mentor, I had them solved. The more I and my mentor had discussions about the game out in the meetings, the more I saw the game getting more interesting and in shape.

One more issue I faced was uploading my files to GitHub as they were pretty large because of the high resolution and duplication of the assets. I removed some of the unused assets too. Which fixed it.

In the end, besides being challenging, the coding period was a lot more fun which also helped me discover the work I can perform and also taught me how things work behind the scenes.

### About the Game 

Sisters of the Faldroid is a 2D platformer game created on the Pocket Code App. In the game, we have two sisters i.e. Diana and Fiora, who are ruling the empire after their father disappears. But later one day, when both sisters were having a conversation, something evil took Fiora with it. Before disappearing, Fiora drops her bracelet which later helps Diana to find her and rescue her. So, you play as Diana to survive and fight till the end to rescue Fiora. The game has a simple UI and design. All of its graphical assets are designed by me and including some of the audio files.
The game shows the potential of the Pocket Code app and shows how it can be used to develop high-quality interactive games and arts.

### Contributing to the Project

The project files (.catrobat files) created during this summer are in the ‘Projects’ folder in the same repository and the final completed project is in the '[GSoC(2021)-Sisters of the Faldroid](https://github.com/Shriyanshu1/DemoGameProject-2021/tree/main/GSoC(2021)-Sisters%20of%20the%20Faldroid)' folder.
